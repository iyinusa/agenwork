## Overview

AgenWork is a Chrome extension that provides AI-powered browsing assistance using Chrome's built-in AI capabilities. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring complete data security. This privacy policy explains how AgenWork handles your information.

## Our Privacy Commitment

## Local Data Storage

AgenWork uses Chrome's local storage API exclusively for:

- Data remains on your device and is never transmitted externally
- You can clear this data anytime through the extension interface

## AI Processing

- All AI processing happens locally on your device
- No content is sent to Google servers or any external service

### Content Access

- Extension only accesses webpage content when you actively request summarization

## International Users

Since AgenWork operates entirely locally without data transmission, there are no international data transfer concerns. Your data never leaves your device regardless of your location.
